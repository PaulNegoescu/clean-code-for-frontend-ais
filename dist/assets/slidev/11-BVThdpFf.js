The HTML page should contain 5 buttons for the user, one for each option. Each button should display the text corresponding to the option and an icon symbol from FontAwesome corresponding to the option. When a user clicks one of the buttons the computer player will make a random choice. The app should display the outcome of the game depending on both choices, like "Computer beats Player" but also display flavour text based on the options selected like "Spock decapitates lizard". The app should keep track of number of Computer and Player wins respectively and display these to the user. The app should also keep and display a log of choices and outcomes. None of these should be persisted in any way, it's display only. `,-1),f={__name:"11",setup(_){return c(o),d(),(y,k)=>(a(),s(i,n(p(e(h)(e(o),10))),{default:r(()=>[m,u]),_:1},16))}},v=l(f,[["__file","/@slidev/slides/11.md"]]);export{v as default};
