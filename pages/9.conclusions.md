# Conclusions

- AI does not do clean-code
- Even in a longer chat, continuously prompting it to do specific things
- The cost/benefit quickly gets out of hand as natural language prompts quickly get longer than code
- Human supervision is required in order to produce <span v-mark.orange>production grade</span> code
- Especially in CSS
- Chat GPT v4o is still outdated, Turbo and Copilot are there but training code still prevents them from providing clean, modern code

# But

- AI is a great tool to help you get results faster, easier, with less digging into docs
- Utility scripts and Mockup code don't care about maintainability, performance (?), or cleanliness

# Why Clean Code?

- More maintainable, understandable, reusable
- We should <span v-mark.circle.orange>write code for programmers</span> not for machines
 
# But

Q: What if AI maintains the code, do I still care? <br>
A: Well, it doesn't, it can't. It's easier for AI to regenerate the whole code taking into account new input but this gets out of hand exponentially, the more you adjust the prompt, the less good the cost/benefit factor is.

Q: But AI improves continuously / You could train a custom LLM to code to your liking?<br>
A: According to research on previous AI models there is a logarithmic tapering of AI performance, at one point it becomes economically unfeasible to feed it more data. Plus current training data is not of good quality (in programming).
