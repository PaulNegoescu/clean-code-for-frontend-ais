# The Problems of AI

1. There is evidence that current AI models including LLMs and Diffusion models are logarithmically tapering in performance and the costs for zero-shot performance would be astronomically high.

2. Training data currently is of questionable quality and this quality gets propagated more by AI
3. Code on the internet is immensely skewed towards old/outdated tech, even if AI has access to current data, most of its input is very old.
4. AI does not understand why it does what it does. It knows how to generate text, even specific text. This is how some logic errors slip through and sometimes it introduces redundant or useless code. Another example is that Chat GPT did not understand why it used `display: grid` in one instance or what the benefits of doing that were, it still used way too many HTML elements for what it needed.

5. AI is not capable of understanding the business needs and extrapolating a solution, especially if it's a new problem. This is why prompts have to be so long and specific. -> Interviews need new problems.

6. AI seems to currently cherry-pick context (even ignoring that most don't hold your full project's context) and it's not good on figuring out what is important in a new problem. AI can't figure out what's important, what a change might cause in terms of regressions or how it might affect something else.

7. The "average result" problem.

8. AI makes itself/each-other worse over time by diluting the training data that is openly available on the internet with sub-par solutions. See the Spotify Recommender Engine in Discover Weekly for a quick and dirty example.
